# bicycle-gene-classifier
We developed a linear logistic regression classifier using only structural features of bicycle genes that identified many putative bicycle homologs in other species.

More information about the research that generated this classifier can be found in the paper (Stern and Han, 2022)[https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evac069] PMID (35660862)[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168663/].

The classifier and instructions on how to use it will be pushed soon.
